# SQL + Python Order Analysis

This project demonstrates how SQL and Python can be integrated to perform end-to-end data operations, from raw data ingestion to analytical insights. It uses a SQL script and a Jupyter Notebook to showcase querying, data transformation, and basic visualization—ideal for entry-level data analytics portfolios.

## 📊 Key Highlights

- ✅ Created 3 SQL tables (`Customer`, `Product`, `Orders`) with 25+ sample records inserted.
- ✅ Executed 10+ SQL queries involving `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY` for data extraction and aggregation.
- ✅ Utilized `pandas` to process and analyze query results within Python.
- ✅ Visualized order trends and customer behavior using basic plots (`matplotlib` / `seaborn`).
- ✅ Integrated SQLite with Python via `sqlite3` to enable in-notebook SQL execution.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `order.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that:
  - Loads SQL data
  - Performs in-memory queries using Python
  - Visualizes customer and order analytics
- `sq.sql`: SQL script for:
  - Table creation (`CREATE TABLE`)
  - Record insertion (`INSERT INTO`)
  - Sample data queries

## 🔍 Features

- 👨‍💻 SQL-Python integration using `sqlite3`
- 📈 In-memory querying and analytics via `pandas`
- 📊 Visual analysis of customer behavior and order volume
- 🧪 Realistic dataset simulating an e-commerce order system

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **SQL**: Data definition and manipulation queries
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Code + results + explanation all in one place
