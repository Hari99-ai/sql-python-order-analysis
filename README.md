# SQL + Python Order Analysis

This project demonstrates how SQL and Python can be integrated to perform data operations and analysis. Using a SQL script and a Jupyter Notebook, we showcase the workflow of querying data, processing it in Python, and visualizing key insights.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `order.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that executes SQL queries using Python (via `sqlite3` or similar), analyzes the results with `pandas`, and visualizes data insights.
- `sq.sql`: Contains SQL queries used to create and manipulate the dataset. Includes table creation, data insertion, and sample queries.

## 🔍 Features

- Integration of SQL queries directly in Python.
- Data exploration and transformation using `pandas`.
- Simple visualizations (if any) to support insights.
- Example use of databases for real-world-like scenarios (orders, customers, etc.).

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` / `seaborn`
- **SQL**: Standard SQL queries for data definition and manipulation
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For combining code, output, and narrative.
